# What is this?

Welcome to this repository. You might be wondering what the purpose of this repo is, to which an answer would be: none. I just got bored.

The alternative purpose is that this repository can be used as boilerplate for your next express-powered API. It contains a node application, configurable using an `env.config.js` file, that provides a single endpoint that says hello back to you. It's almost the same as having a friend!

## Install your NPM packages

`npm install` or simply `npm i`

## Run the thing

`npm run dev`. It uses `nodemon` as dev dependency for those lovely errors that will surely pop up when developing an API.
